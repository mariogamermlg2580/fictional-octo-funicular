# Sir Autismos Tavern iOS Wrapper

This is a native iOS wrapper for the HTML game. It opens `SirAutismosTavern/Web/index.html` in a fullscreen `WKWebView`.

You need macOS + Xcode to compile the iOS binary. Windows can prepare the files, but it cannot produce the iPhone executable inside an IPA.

To make an unsigned IPA on a Mac:

```bash
cd ios/SirAutismosTavern
chmod +x build_unsigned_ipa.sh
./build_unsigned_ipa.sh
```

Output:

```text
ios/SirAutismosTavern/dist/Sir Autismos Tavern Cards and Stuff - unsigned.ipa
```

Then sign it with your Apple developer identity/provisioning profile, or open `SirAutismosTavern.xcodeproj` in Xcode and archive/export with your signing settings.
